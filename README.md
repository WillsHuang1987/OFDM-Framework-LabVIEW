大标题  
===================================  
  大标题一般显示工程名,类似html的\<h1\><br />  
  你只要在标题下面跟上=====即可  
This is an OFDM framework based on LabVIEW and USRP. This framework contains a complete physical layer structure refferred to 802.11a package.
It includes common OFDM modulation and demodulation, ferquency offset estimation and correction via WLAN STF, LTF and SIG. And supports binary convolution channel coding and high order symbol mapping.
Gnerally, it is already a complete framework. Although it may have some bugs, but it is tough enough to be a good template. And I will keep updating utill June, 2017
You can visit my website to ask for help and I will share experience about build this framework and other notations.
